The people around me inspired me for this work. During my college years, I made many friends. Some were gay, some were lesbians, some were transgender, and some were straight. In them, I see growth, strength, and vulnerability. I believe that a person's experience will influence their sexual orientation to a certain extent, so I began the research on this topic.<br/>


I interviewed them about this topic to understand the psychological process of different groups about sexual orientation and their self-perception. Regardless of their sexual preference, everyone has a colorful soul and a special journey in life. The stories of the LGBTQ community are quite rough, and the stories of straight men and women are relatively more peaceful, which I believe is unfair. Thus, I decided to present their stories in my illustrations for others to experience.<br/>


After obtaining the feedback from the interviews, I asked my friends for their photos, photographs of their favorite things and images related to their stories. Then, I made a group of stickers with these photos to better represent their characteristics.<br/>


Afterward, I referred to the form of tarot cards and condensed the interview content into several characters presented as tarot characters. I designed independent character settings to supplement their background and attached a short story next to each tarot.<br/>


This work is my first complete illustration project. Under the guidance of my tutor, I experimented with a new style of painting. I learned how to express specific stories abstractly on a 2D surface and organized visual language and the narration for the illustration. It was a frustrating learning process but also rewarding.<br/>

Dream of the Red Chamber is the inspiration of project two. It is my favorite ancient Chinese romance novel and is also known as the literary peak of novels in the Ming and Qing dynasties. It can be seen as the Chinese Hamlet, with thousands of interpretations for thousands of people. I believe we can all see ourselves in  Dream of the Red Chamber. In the novel, there are twelve young female characters with different personalities. In my opinion, their characteristics are greatly influenced by their family backgrounds. Therefore, I decided to study the relationship between the families and personalities of the Twelve Beauties of Jinling and create a picture book on this theme. I interviewed people around meï¼Œcompared their families with the main characters of the Twelve Beauties of Jinling and found similarities between their personalities.
<br>

This project discusses the relationship between family origin and personality, which pushed me to research related psychological studies. I have a great interest in traditional Chinese culture. In this project, I also investigated traditional Chinese architecture, clothing, and art, especially the traditional Chinese art form, Jiehua.
<br>

The Twelve Beauties of Jinling have been a common motif of visual art creation in China since the Ming and Qing dynasties, so it was easy to find relevant ancient paintings of the two dynasties. I achieved the black and white background style by combining modern film and television works with my own understanding. As family stories are mostly about memories, I first used the creative technique of moving and changing scenery in Chinese paintings, along with the abstract way of expression and a single color tone to present a hazy and gloomy atmosphere. This project relies more on composition than the feeling of painting, and it's a whole new experience for me. I created a theme cover, implying the oppression of women and the awakening of their minds.

<br>

In addition, I designed a small installation that shows these women imprisoned like canaries in gorgeous mansions. I have also cut pieces of the picture, pasted them on a black cloth, covered my head with it and took photographs to express their longing for light. Still, they could only reach out helplessly.
In the future, I plan to research Jiehua paintings and try to integrate this art form into my illustrations.

This project is a set of commercial illustrations I designed, mainly about the source and usage of vitamins. When I was studying in the United States,
 many of my friends took vitamin supplements like medicine. Since I am not a big fan of lettuce, I am also a supporter of vitamin supplements. 
 But many people in China often say they can not understand this behavior because they believe that the healthiest way to acquire nutrition is through direct food intake. 
 Therefore, I made a questionnaire about vitamins and listed six vitamins that are most commonly consumed and seen by people based on the survey results to popularize their efficacy and ways of acquiring, namely vitamins A, B6, C, D, E, and H. I believe this project is a popular science illustration with certain commercial value, so I chose a bright, lovely, and easy-to-understand painting style. I personified vitamins and placed them in different factories. Readers can understand the vitamin's main value and raw material through their actions. In terms of the design method, I adopted the relatively flat style of pop art. Each vitamin has a different appearance and color scheme, and through these artistic choices, I hope to bring audiences a different view on vitamins. I have an unconstrained style of the thinking process and do not like to memorize things, so I thought this would be a great way to show others the functions of vitamins in a visualized form.<br/>
	
In addition, I believe the output should be more diversified, and its commercial value should be more thoroughly developed. Following the previous design of vitamins, I created some graphic designs, combined them with illustrations, and made a series of packaging. Combined with my undergraduate knowledge of advertising design, I printed out my images, designed a cover, and created a four-fold pop-up book to showcase the final output. In my opinion, apart from commercial value, this project has indeed popularized the functions and effects of vitamins, including tonic and medicine. I will combine more of my thoughts with reality in my future works to better present my ideas to the public.<br/>

I have always loved animals, and I often volunteered at animal shelters when I went to university in the United States. However, the charity work for stray animals in China is currently underdeveloped. So I decided to call on the public's attention to homeless animals to provide them with a warm shelter.
<br/>

<br/>
I worked as a publicity volunteer in Ping An A Fu, a civil stray animal shelter in Nanjing, during which I interviewed many animal relief workers and had a basic understanding of the living situations of stray animals in Nanjing. The workers organize offline activities once a month to help homeless animals find adopters. I designed stickers, posters, and postcards for this event and sold them for charity. The profits raised were used to sterilize two stray cats.


<br/>
I selected cats and dogs with strong characteristics, combined with their experiences, to give them artistic appearances. I believe stray cats and dogs are different from home pets. They are not clean and are afraid of people, but they are adorable in their own way. They are stubborn and independent and have a certain toughness. So I referred to the graffiti works of Jean-Michel Basquiat and created a narrative illustration to introduce the difference between stray animals before and after they were adopted. I also made two posters for the adoption ceremony.
<br/>
In addition, I made a sheet to visualize the data I collected and hope these data can firmly support my entire project.

 The inspiration for this project came from a kitten named Summer at a relief station in Nanjing. Summer was a cat with a great personality, but she was abandoned because she was not very cute and suffered a lot of unfair treatment, so I decided to do a children's picture book project to show children that they should not judge people by their appearance, but only when they really get to know and understand them.
   <br/>I referred to a number of classic children's picture books such as "I want my hat back" and "Big Mouth Dog" to create my own story line and character design. I consulted a lot of information on the psychology of early childhood education and used relatively bright colors to present my story because I thought these character designs and colors were more in line with children's aesthetics and logic. I also kept revising my text and lines to make sure that the children could understand my story without any pressure. The story of this picture book is relatively simple and not too long, which makes it perfect for children to read. 
  <br/> Instead of the common A4 size, I used a children's picture book size of 210mm*185mm because I thought the audience for this book was children aged 3 to 10 and this was the best size for them, as well as allowing for better composition and interpretation of my images. I chose the same appearance as summer is not pleasant slug as my protagonist, and put him in a fairy tale world to meet the curiosity of children. gabagaba after a series of things to finally sink, get everyone's respect and love. The address of this story is to emphasize the importance of inner beauty, to tell everyone that appearance is only one aspect, the inner is the aspect of judging a person. While reading the story, children can also gain other knowledge, such as the need to protect the environment. I also hope that summer can harvest their own happiness soon.
<br/>I printed out my picture book and chose two different printing methods. First I used 300g coated paper and printed a paperback. On the cover I cut out GABAGABA to enhance the sense of interaction. Then I made the hardcover book on butterfly-bound cardstock. The hardcover has a better texture and is a bit thicker up to the tuck. But because of the cardboard can not be cut out, there is no sense of interaction design.
<br/>In addition, I made a small device to give GABAGABA for Christmas. I used super light clay to mix with mixed materials to make a snowy effect, and then combined with other mixed materials (stoneware clay, oil stick, watercolor, acrylic, wool, etc.) to make a complete installation and to have a clearer understanding of mixed materials.
